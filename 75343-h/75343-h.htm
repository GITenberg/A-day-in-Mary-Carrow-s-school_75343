</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c007'>After the roll had been called, the little
boys and girls were invited to say a lesson
first; because Mary, the teacher, thought the
bigger ones could better understand why
they were to wait.</p>

<p class='c008'>They took their places in the class, and
she gave out words of two syllables for them
to spell; such as Cam-el, Pea-cock, Hen-coop,
Par-lor, Tea-cup.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>When they had done spelling, she allowed
them to ask questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>One little boy, whose name was Harry
Linn, asked what a camel was? And Mary
took down a large book from the shelf, and
showed him a picture of a camel, and told
him that it was a native both of Arabia and
of Africa, and that it could travel eight or
nine days without water, over the sandy
deserts of those countries. It is covered with
a hairy fur, which it sheds in the spring,
and this fur is used to make coarse cloth
shawls. The camel kneels down to receive
burdens, and when it is loaded it will rise
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry was very much surprised, when
his teacher told him that the camel could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>carry men and burdens like a horse or an
ass, and could travel a great distance with a
weight of eight hundred or a thousand pounds
upon its back; and that it gave milk for
drink, like a cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry asked why we had not camels in
America, instead of horses and cows?</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary told him that God had made this
a very large world, and that it is divided
into many countries. In some countries the
weather is very hot, and in some countries
it is very cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animals and people, who are born in
hot countries, such as Arabia and Africa,
could not endure the cold of America. They
are happier and more useful in the climate
where they are born.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>And Mary said, our heavenly Father was
so good and kind to every thing that he had
made, that he designed all animals, as well
as little boys and girls and men and women
too, to be useful and happy where he placed
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry asked if a little boy like him could
be useful and happy? for Harry was only
four years old.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary told him, yes; and that when she
had leisure, she would read aloud to him
and his school-mates the story of a little
girl who was only four years old, who was
happy because she was useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry loved his teacher, because she was
so kind to him, and though he wanted very
much to know how he could be useful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>happy, he knew she had not time to answer
any more questions now; and he was willing
to wait, for his teacher always did what she
said she would do, and Harry was sure she
would not forget her promise.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he went to his seat as the other little
boys and girls did, and while Mary heard
the larger scholars say their definitions,
Harry’s class made O’s, and strokes, and pothooks
on their slates, as they are called, in
this way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='handwriting practice' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mary had only eight scholars, and she had
leisure to attend to each one, and make them
understand all their lessons, that they might
have something to think about when they
went home from school.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>On this morning the scholars were exercised
in spelling, reading and arithmetic.
The large boys and girls did sums in multiplication
and subtraction, and the smaller
ones made figures, after Mary had written
a line upon their slates for them thus:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='large'>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After they had been two hours in school,
Mary rang a little bell. As soon as they
heard it, they knew it was recess-time, and
they all went out to play for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The school was in the country, on the
farm where Harry Linn’s father and mother
lived, and Mary lived with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary had been to the best schools to receive
her education; and she was very fond
of two things—learning and children. So,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>she agreed to come and live with Harry
Linn’s father and mother, and teach school:
and she had five of the neighbouring children,
besides Harry and his brother and sister,
for scholars.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><b class="old-english">First Day.</b><br>  The School House at the edge of the wood. p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The school-room was built at the edge of
a piece of “woods,” not far from the house,
and it was very cool and shady round about,
all summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the winter, when the leaves had fallen
off from the trees, the sun shone in at the
school-room windows, and it was so light and
cheerful that the teacher and her scholars
liked to be there better than anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Linn’s father used to say that
Mary’s face was sunshiny, because it was
so good-humoured. When her little flock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>went out to play, at recess-time, she sometimes
went too, for the sake of the exercise;
and they were always glad when Mary
went with them. She would take turns
with them in jumping rope, and playing
“Let us see who can run fastest;” and she
would show the boys how to trundle their
hoops; and she knew how to fix the paper
sails to the little boats which the boys made
for themselves; and then she would take them
along by the side of the little brook of water
that was down in the woods, and find a place
for them where they could stoop down without
getting their feet wet, to sail their boats.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the home-made boats was such a
fast sailer that Charles Linn, who was quite
a little carpenter, asked Mary to print
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>a name on his boat. She asked, “What shall
its name be?” But they could not agree upon
a name, for one wanted one name, and
another wanted something different. So
Mary cut up a piece of paper which she had
in her hand into nine slips; and then she
went round to each scholar, and told every
one to whisper to her the name he or she
liked best; and she wrote down the choice
of each one on a separate slip of the paper,
and lastly, on the ninth slip, she wrote down
the name which she herself preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this was done, Mary read the names
written down, aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two of the scholars had chosen the name
of “Swan.” Three had chosen the name of
“Mary,” and four had chosen the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Water-witch.” So the little fast-sailing
boat was named “Water-witch.” I suppose
they had talked about this name before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” said Mary, “we will all go back
to school;” and her happy little scholars were
ready to do as she wished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary remembered her promise to Harry
Linn, to read him a story which would teach
him how a little girl of four years old could
be useful and happy. And she said all who
wished to hear it might put by their books
and slates, while she read it to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all liked to have Mary read to them,
and all the scholars put up their work to
listen to her.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>My little Anne Lyle.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mary’s scholars were all very still and attentive
while she was reading to them about
Anne Lyle, and when she had finished it,
she asked Harry if he did not think Anne
Lyle was a useful, happy, little girl? She
waited on her mother, and walked in the
garden with her blind, old grandfather, and
put away his hat and cane for him, and kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>her little brother quiet; and she was a kind
little girl too, for she took something good to
the sick cook, and saved some of her pennies
to buy shoes for a poor beggar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry said, “Yes: and if I knew how, I
would like to be useful too.” Mary reminded
him that one of his school-mates had lost her
sponge, and when she wanted to rub from
her slate some crooked strokes that she had
made, she asked Harry for his sponge, and he
had refused to lend it to her, because he
wanted it himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might have been useful, then,
Harry,” said Mary, “but you did not choose
to be so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry hung his head and looked ashamed;
but presently he ran away to his desk, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>brought out his sponge, and gave it to Lily
Forester; (for that was the little girl’s name
who had asked him for it.) Lily said, “Thank
you, Harry,” and she cleaned her slate off
nicely with it, and gave it back to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>His teacher stroked Harry’s hair with her
hand, and said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, has not my little boy of four years
old learned to be useful?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry hid his curly head behind Mary’s
apron for a few moments, and then he peeped
up into her kind face, and she knew he meant
Yes, though he did not say any thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” said Mary, “my little Harry has
discovered that he can be useful; and that
when he is useful, he is happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Harry scampered off, and sat close by Lily
Forester till school was out.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the afternoon, Mary’s scholars were all
collected around the school-room door before
she arrived. As soon as they saw her coming,
they ran to meet her, and Susan Field
brought a bunch of beautiful flowers for her.
Mary was very fond of flowers, and she
thanked Susan, and said she would keep
them in water for her little scholar’s sake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she took a china vase which she
kept for flowers, and allowed all her scholars
to go with her down to the spring for fresh
water; and she filled the vase with water
and arranged the flowers, and then she said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we will all go to school, and enjoy
them together.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Three afternoons in the week Mary taught
her scholars to sew, and knit, and work samplers
on canvas. She thought every little girl
should know how to use the needle, and cut
out garments. Then, when she grew up
to be a woman, she could keep her own
wardrobe neatly, and be <i>helpful</i> in her family
besides; and if she had leisure, after doing
her share of the family sewing, she could
teach poor little children, and make garments
for the sick and old, who were not able to
help themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was sewing afternoon. As soon as
they were all in their seats, Mary took out a
large work-basket, that was filled with little
parcels, nicely wrapped up, and the owner’s
name was written on each parcel. Lily Forester
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and Harry Linn stood beside Mary to
pass along the work as she gave it to them.
They were the youngest scholars in the
school, and they were always glad when
sewing afternoon came, because they could
help Mary.</p>

<p class='c008'>One girl had a pocket handkerchief to hem
for her brother; one had some patch-work;
one was working a Bible-cover in cross-stitch;
one was learning to knit a garter; and little
Lily’s work was an apron for her doll, which
Mary had fitted for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the girls were busied at their work,
the boys, (except Harry Linn,) stood up to
say a geography lesson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, my little readers, whoever you may
be, can you tell how many boys were in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>geography class? You will remember Mary
had eight scholars. Read over how many
girls were at their sewing, then add to their
number Harry Linn, and say how many boys
were in the class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry and Lily, somehow or other, always
had their little heads close together. Harry
liked to help Lily, and Lily liked to help
Harry. Sometimes, like other little children,
they quarrelled; but they soon became friends
again without any body’s help; and then
Harry would say, “Come, Lily, let us kiss
and make up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This afternoon, Harry asked leave to show
Lily a picture-book which his father had
given him, and Mary told him he might sit
by Lily, as soon as she had finished a finger’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>length of hemming. Harry waited till
the sewing was done, and then he sat close
to Lily, and showed her his picture-book.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><b class="old-english">First Day.</b><br>  One of Harry’s Pictures. p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was a picture of two little humming-birds
and a nest; and one of a horse,
with a boy and a bag of flour on his back;
and Harry told Lily, the little boy was coming
home from the mill, with a bag of flour to
make some cakes for supper; and Lily said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Harry, I would like to have some of the
cakes; wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry’s book had more pictures than these
two in it. There was one of a little girl
feeding chickens, and one of a shepherd and
his sheep, and one of a boy spinning a
famous top.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lily liked the picture of the little girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>feeding chickens best: and Harry liked the
picture of the boy and his top best. And
Harry said to Lily,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lily, if you will look at my picture first,
then I will look at your picture;” but Lily
was tired of looking at Harry’s picture; and
she said it was ugly; and she moved away
from Harry.</p>

<p class='c008'>This offended Harry, and he told her he
didn’t love her any more, and she should not
see his book. And he went away from Lily
and took his book with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the boys, who had been saying a
geography lesson, had taken their seats,
Mary called Harry and Lily to come and repeat
the multiplication table.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not come when they were called,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and Mary knew from their looks and behaviour,
that they had been naughty. But
she only said to them again very mildly,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Harry, come Lily,—it is almost
recess-time, and you have not said a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry came along very slowly, at first, and
looking sidewise to see if Lily was coming too.
At length she took her place beside him, but
they missed their tables. They knew they
had done wrong, and they felt very unhappy,
and they did not think enough about their
tables to answer correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the scholars went out to play at
recess-time, Harry and Lily did not swing,
and run, and play with one another. They
walked about apart, and they hardly knew
what to do with themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Harry’s brother Charles went and got his
fast-sailing little boat, and ran back to the
school-house to Mary, to ask her to print on
it in large letters, “The Water-witch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary laid down her work and took a pen
and did it for him immediately, and he said,
“I thank you,” and then he ran away,
and all the scholars, (boys and girls,) after
him, down to the spring, to see how the boat
looked upon the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sailed beautifully, and there was quite
a little fleet of boats behind her, but the
“Water-witch” went ahead of them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>While they were watching the boats the
bell rang for school.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Charles took his little boats, and all
the boys and girls took their hoops, and ropes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and all their playthings, and put them into
a little tool-house, which Charles Linn’s father
allowed them to use for that purpose; and
Mary made a rule, that every thing must be
put into its proper place, so that even their
playthings should not be lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they all came back to school. Mary
was there waiting for them. She had not
gone out with them this afternoon, but had
stayed in school to fit the girls’ work, and
to set copies, in books, for the scholars who
used pen and ink, and on slates, for the
smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they returned from play, she called
them up, one by one, to read, and after each
scholar had done reading, he went to his
desk and wrote a copy; and then Mary said,</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“It is now time to put up work.” The
girls all rolled up their work, and pinned
their names on it, and held it in their hands
till Harry and Lily should come to get the
different parcels and put them in the large
work-basket; but as Harry and Lily had
been naughty, Mary did not ask them to do
it this time; so every girl put away her own
work. Lily had not learned to fold up hers,
and put it away neatly, and she usually
brought it to Mary, and said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please, Mary, fold up mine?” and Mary
folded it up for her, and Lily always watched
how it was done, so that she might learn.
We can learn a great deal by the right use
of our eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>This afternoon Lily brought her work to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Mary, and turned away her head, while
Mary put it away, but she did not say
“thank you,” as usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary now went round to see if all the
desks were in order. One little girl, Carry
Deacon, said her desk would not hold all
her things, and she tried her best to get them
all in, but she could not; so Mary went to
her and had her to take every thing out of
the desk first, and then she showed her how
to arrange her reading book and her spelling
book, and her other books, all on one side of
the desk, and her slate on the other side;
and then there was plenty of room for all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary looked into every scholar’s desk, to
see that it was neatly arranged; and if she
found it out of order, she would point to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>large letters that were printed over the mantel-piece.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would my little readers like to know
what those large letters were?”</p>

<p class='c008'>I will tell them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A PLACE FOR EVERY THING,</div>
    <div>AND</div>
    <div>EVERY THING IN ITS PLACE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If Mary’s scholars wanted her aid about
any thing, she would always help them, and
they knew that she never required any thing
of them, which could not be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the close of every afternoon school, it
was Mary’s practice to gather her little flock
round her, and read to them out of the Bible.
Sometimes, when the weather was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>warm, she took them out into the woods, and
sat down with them on the grass under a
large oak tree. They liked to go out of doors
to read; for they loved Mary, and they could
sit very close to her under the oak tree while
she read to them. Eddy Forester said he
liked to read out of doors, for it seemed as
if God was listening, up in the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a very warm afternoon, and Mary
said she would read under the oak tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eddy Forester carried the Bible, and when
they were all seated, Mary read to them the
history of little Samuel, and how his heavenly
Father called him when he lay down
to sleep in the temple.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Mary had done reading, Eddy Forester
asked, why little Samuel went to Eli
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>to inquire if he called him, when it was
the Lord that called him?</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary said, “Samuel was a very little boy,
and he did not know that it was the Lord
who had spoken to him. Our heavenly
Father often speaks to little children now by
his good Spirit, when they are too young to
understand who it is that speaks to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When we do right, we feel something
which seems to say to us, ‘Well done!’ and
then we are happy; and when we do wrong,
we feel something which seems to say to us
that it is wrong, and then we are unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it the Lord that makes us feel so?”
asked Susan Field?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” said Mary, “and we should
be very thankful to him that we are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>happy when we have done that which we
know to be wrong; and we should pray that
God would teach us by his Holy Spirit what
is right and what is wrong, and make us understand
and love what he has taught us in
the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes!” said Eddy Forester, “I know
what you mean, for my mother told me—the
other day, when I snatched an apple from
George because he would not give me a bite
of it—she told me that I did not enjoy eating
the apple, and it did not taste good to
me, because I had been very naughty to take
it away from George, and that our heavenly
Father’s good Spirit was rebuking me and
making me feel unhappy all the time I was
eating George’s apple.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>While Eddy was talking, little Lily came
and sat by Mary, and now she was sobbing
and crying out aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scholars all wondered what was the
matter with Lily, but Mary said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind, Lily, now;” and she only
drew Lily close to her and said, “Don’t cry,
Lily dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Linn crept round to Lily very
quietly, and took out his little picture-book,
and whispered to her, “Here, Lily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was too much distressed to notice
Harry, though he got as near to her as ever
he could.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary now asked Eddy Forester to go on
with what he was saying, but Eddy said he
had done, and that he was glad the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>spoke to little children now, even if they did
not hear any voice, as Samuel did.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary wished her little scholars to understand
what she read to them, and she encouraged
them to ask questions, at suitable
times.</p>

<p class='c008'>She now told them if they had no more
questions to ask, they might go home; all
but Harry and Lily. So, they came one by
one, and kissed Mary and went home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eddy Forester said he would wait for Lily;
but Mary told him she would bring Lily
home, and he might tell his mother that she
kept Lily and Harry Linn to talk to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Eddy was gone, Mary took Lily up
in her arms, and then she called Harry to
her, and told him to wipe off Lily’s tears;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and Harry took his handkerchief out of his
pocket and wiped Lily’s face, and he said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lily, will you love me again? and then
I’ll love you, and you may look at the little
girl feeding her chickens as long as you
like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lily said, “I do love you, Harry,” and
she put her arms round Harry’s neck and
they kissed one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Mary tied on Lily’s bonnet for her,
and Harry put on his hat, and carried the
Bible back to the school-room for his teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary locked up the school-room door and
put the key in her pocket, and then she took
a hand of each of her little scholars, and said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Harry, you and I will go home
with Lily, shall we?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>You will remember, my little readers, that
Mary lived with Harry Linn. As they
walked along, Harry seemed to be thinking
about something, and at last he said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mary, does our heavenly Father ever
speak to little children like me and
Lily?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary said, “Yes! Harry, he has been
speaking to you both, since you were naughty.
You sinned against his good Spirit when you
quarrelled, and he made you feel very unhappy
because you were so disobliging to one
another, and had forgotten that he had told
you to love one another. But I hope you
will hereafter know and obey his voice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” said Lily, “I love to hear my heavenly
Father’s voice.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“So do I,” said Harry, “it makes me feel
so happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You feel happy because you <i>obeyed</i> His
voice,” said Mary, “and we are always happy
when we are obedient to God. He loves us
so much, and is so kind to us, that he never
tells us to do any thing that we cannot do;
and if it seems hard, and we ask him, he
will help us to do it. He tells little children
to do very little things, because he loves
them, and he knows they are too little to do
great things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope our heavenly Father will talk to
me and Lily often,” said Harry, “do you
think he will, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, if you are good children.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“And will he show us how to be good?”
asked Lily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes,” Mary said, “for you know
he showed little Samuel what he would have
him do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does he love Lily and me as much as
he loved little Samuel, Mary,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary told him that God loved all little
children, and he sent our Saviour to bless
them and to bring them to him. Do you remember,
Harry, what our Saviour said about
little children?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Harry, “He said, ‘Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them
not!’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now we are at Lily’s home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary took Lily in to her mother, and told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>her that she kept Lily to talk to her, and
Lily’s mother said,</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am glad to see my little daughter, for
her supper of nice bread and milk is all ready
for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lily’s mother asked Mary and Harry to
stay and eat supper; but Mary said they had
not leave to stay, and Harry’s father and
mother would not know where they were, if
they stayed. So she thanked Lily’s mother
for her invitation, and then she and Harry
kissed Lily, and bade her good-night. And
Mary and Harry went home.</p>
